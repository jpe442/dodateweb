DoDate is a Kanban-inspired todo productivity solution wherein users create unscheduled todos in a list and then manipulated by 
the user in an ergonomic left-to-right workflow across a one-week calendar. 



Configure independently hosted Rails backend to: 
 accept cross-origin requests from front-end web or mobile client.
 prepare JSON responses for optimal front-end stateshape using jBuilder.
 return JSON responses for session management and todo item CRUD functionality to authorized client requests.
Implement Redux Flux information architecture in both web and Native application frontends for unidirectional data flow. 
Leverage React Drag and Drop (React DnD) module to preserve Flux architecture when users drag and drop todos in DOM. 
Integrate customized Material UI components into Redux loop for industry standard UI/UX functionality and ergonomics.
Automate AJAX updates to Google Calendar API to asynchronously populate calendar items from database.
Manage developer workflow across multiple branches and independent Git repositories using GitHub tools for primary milestones and Slack channels for instant live communication.
