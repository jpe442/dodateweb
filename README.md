[//]: # (Brief explanation of what the app is and does)

DoDate is a Kanban-inspired todo productivity solution wherein users can create unscheduled todos in a list (todo), distribute them accross a one-week calendar (doing), and finally mark them as complete to move them off the calendar to another list (done). Utilizing the latest frontend technologies - *Redux, ReactJS, React Native, React DnD, and Material UI* - DoDate epidomizes the modern single-page-app (SPA).

### Technologies Utilized
#### Frontends

##### DoDate's primary frontend is built in ReactJS using JavaScript ES6, HTML5, CSS3. 

*React with Redux*

&#9733; React components are arranged and interelated according to a [FLUX](https://facebook.github.io/flux/) architecture using [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/blob/master/README.md) to provide a unidirectional flow of information which ensures that backend data stays in sync with the frontend state of the client application. 

*React DnD*

   > &#9733; Todos in DoDate can be easily dragged throughout the UI without a possibility of becoming out of sync with the backend database.

&#9733; Changes in data initiated by the user dragging todos on the frontend are sent to the backend database before coming  [React Drag-and-Drop (DnD)](https://github.com/react-dnd/react-dnd) module to preserve the integrity of the Redux loop.
